        We can first take a look at Buddhism. Those who practice Buddhism strive to achieve a state of enlightenment, also known as Nirvana. Buddhism points out that we hae a deep powerful pull on us to hold on to physical, mental, and emotional baggage which we can't possibly fufill, cure and sometimes cause ourselves. This pull or thirst is what keeps us in a endless cycle of pain. 
        
          By being mindful of the Four Noble Truths; suffering, desire, cessation and the path of liberation from suffering, we
        can achieve Nirvana, also known as the quenching. In this state, you no longer controlled by your many forms of pain. You live each moment as it comes, not dwell in the past or in what is yet to come. Living this simplistic lifestyle of not wanting
        more that you need, placing value in what you already have and becoming fully aware of your behavior and their effects, you can now be content in the moment and every following moment after that. Free to enjoy all aspects of life.

      <p>Henry David Thoreau was an American philosopher who was best known for his book Walden. In this book he wrote about his life in the woods and the experiences he had over two years removed from city living. He simply lives off the land and goes to
        work. Thoreau reflects on how chores that was once looked at as tedious have become a source of amusement. He talks about living in the moment, “being forever on alert” and “looking always at what is to been seen”. “I watch the passage of the
        morning cars with the same feeling that I do the rising of the sun.”
        
      Thoreau enjoys solitude and embraces the self-reflection. He talks about the escape from the pressures of daily affairs and enjoying a newly found hobby of painting. He comes to realize that through self-reliance, simplicity and self-reflection,
        you can achieve inner peace and contentment. By living this simplistic lifestyle he was able to “live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.”

    <div class="ma">
      <p>"MA" is a Japanese word that is roughly translated to
      "space between two strutual parts". Rather than focus on
      the items themselves, MA is about the experience someone
      has in this negative space. MA is what makes minimalism
      possible. It is the "emptiness full of possibilities".
