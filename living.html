              Before the micro-living movement Japan had already took steps
              toward this modern idea. We initially see this capsule style
              lodgings or metabolism architecture in the Nakagin Capsule Tower, 
              which was built in 1972. Metabolism architecture combines megastructures
              and biological growth. This unique building has 140 units. Each unit is
              about 8ft by 13feet and is complete with a bathroom, stove, refrigerator,
              and TV.  Each capsule was created independently so if there was any a
              reason something had to be structurally fixed, they would simply remove 
              the whole unit. There was also a way to link more than one capsule if you
              wanted to have more than one room.

              In Providence Rhode Island, the oldest shopping mall also known as
              The Arcade Providence, has been converted into micro apartments.
              These apartments range from 225sq to 775sq. These apartments come fully
              furnished with a full-size bed with 4 draws under, small kitchen
              (with table), sofa, 50 inch flat screen TV, dishwasher, and microwave.
              They do not have ovens or a stove stop. As an added benefit of it being
              a former mall, it allows neighbors to form connections. The Arcade has a
              fabulous common area furnished with a large seating area, TV, bike 
              parking, and extra storage.  Having such a small amount of living space
              allows you to focus on life outside yourself.

              Micro Apartments and Container Homes are becoming more and morepopular. 
              Taking a page out of capsule living, micro living allows one to have a
              lavish home without the need to have items to fill spaces. This uptrend
              has people coming up with creative ways to store and change their
              surroundings. Such ideas would be reinventing the Murphy bed.  The Murphy
              bed is a bed, with the assistance of springs and hinges, allows the bed to
              be placed in the upright position against the wall. It is hidden in what
              looks to be an average armoire. The new Murphy bed provides a couch as well
              as a workspace when it is in the upright position.

              Micro Apartments takes advantage of technology by allowing your bed, 
              couch and work space to be all in one and maybe only take up 24 square feet
              of space. With the ability to move walls with the push of a button, you can
              expand a living room in a matter of seconds.

               Container homes reusing gigantic shipping containers and 
               convert them into a living space. Not only are reducing waste
               but this is extremely affordable.  Micro living allows you to 
               enjoy negative space. It forces you to constantly make sure the 
               few items you do have, have value and purpose. Having a small living
               space allows you to reflect on the world around you, and gives you a better 
               sense of self as well as the impact you may have on your environment.
