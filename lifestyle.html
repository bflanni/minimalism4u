      Meditation can change your life. 
      By starting with 5 minutes out of your day to 
      clear your mind, it can change your whole mindset. 
      It takes practice to clear your mind of all thoughts, but once
      accomplished, a sense of calm comes over you. It allows you to then 
      think more clearly.

        Another part of balancing your life is becoming more mindful. 
        It is being more aware of how your actions impact the world around 
        you. This can be a physical response, a mental response, or an emotional
        response. A great book to look into is <em> The POWER OF <strong>NOW</strong> by Eckhart Tolle</em>

    Minimalism is about simplifying your life. 
    This also includes decluttering your home. 
    A clean, oranized home allows for more space physically 
    and mentally. 
    
    When a home is messy it can put up mental blocks. 
    A book that can help with that is <em> The life-changing magic
    of tidyng up by Marie Kondo. </em>

   Becoming a minimalist doesnt mean you are starving yourself. 
   It means eathing healthier and making better meal choices. 
   Cutting processed foods, eating more vegetables, Cutting back on 
   sugar and drinking more water. Some might want to look into intermittent
   fasting. Intermittent fasting is only having a small window and for the 
   rest of the day you are drinking water, herbal tea or black coffee. 
   This is easier than it sounds.

  their website, books, podcast, and documentary." They are truly an 
  inspiration when it comes to becoming a minimalist and minimalism as a
  whole.
